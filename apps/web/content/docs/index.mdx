title: Todo Tracking - KISS
description: Minimal data model and flows after reset
---

## Product focus

- Keep everything as small and clear as possible (KISS).
- Real-time syncing stays powered by Convex.
- All effort now centers on a single todo list experience.

## Data model

- Todos
  - Field: text (string description of the task).
  - Field: completed (boolean flag).
  - Convex automatically provides fields _id and _creationTime.

## Core flows

- Add a task: call todos.create with the text.
- View list: subscribe via todos.list to see changes live.
- Toggle done: call todos.toggle to flip the completed flag.
- Delete: call todos.remove when a task is no longer needed.

## Suggested UX touches

- Mobile friendly layout with clear tap targets.
- Inline create field with optimistic feedback.
- Simple filter buttons (All / Active / Completed) if needed later.
- Show last update time so operators know when sync happened.

## Next steps

- Flesh out the UI in apps/web to consume the todo functions.
- Add client-side validation and optimistic updates.
- Re-run npx convex codegen whenever schema or functions change.
